**Disclaimer: Herein lies Project Euler spoilers!**

This repository contains my solutions to the Project Euler problems in Haskell.
Project Euler is a great way to learn a new language, and Haskell is a great 
language for solving the types of problems Project Euler presents, so I'm 
attempting to solve and post my solutions to the first 100 problems.

_I'm not a great Haskell programmer or mathematician_. These solutions are 
probably not the most idiomatic way to solve each problem in Haskell, and they
are often not the most efficient solutions. If you've got a suggestion,
please make a 
[pull request](https://github.com/chrisfosterelli/euler.hs/compare?expand=1)!

If you'd like to solve the [Project Euler Problems](https://projecteuler.net/),
please be aware that looking at any of the solutions in this repository is 
_cheating_ and high discouraged. Additionally, many of the problems require 
prior mathematical work with a pen and paper to simplify it into something that
a computer can efficiently solve, and those bits are not included here! It
won't be good learning material if you use these to help you solve the problems,
so you should keep trying and look elsewhere!
